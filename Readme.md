# FuzeENG

2D game developed in Godot Engine.
The Goal is to recreate the game FuzeCat original, the one online, without the ugly graphics.

For now, I put ennemies that do nothing, and the player can shoot.
I will add another player, and the ability to play with a friend.
And the goal will be to kill the other player.
